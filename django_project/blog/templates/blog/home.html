    <p>The aim of this project was to carry out implement the new techniques and coding skills I have attained while learning Python
        and it's powerful web development framework Django. 
    </p>
    <p>Everything you see and and interact with throughout this site was 
        created by Daniel Lambert. It most certainly didn't happen overnight and it's also not 100% finished. I will continue to add web-apps and functionailty to
        this project as time moves forward.
